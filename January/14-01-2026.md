**Prompt:** Address Something that Cannot Answer

# A Letter Unsent
I suppose you really can't \
Answer a letter never sent \
And I won't \
For fear that you don't \
Feel the same as me. \

Though should you humor me, \
I'll go on a date with glee. \
Dinner and a movie, \
To me sounds quite lovely, \
If you'll go out with me. \

It's a chore to even ask, \
Doing so would interrupt your tasks. \
So, ask you I won't \
Cause I figure you don't \
Feel the same as me.
