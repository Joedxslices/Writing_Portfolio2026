**Prompt:** Sound over meaning


# Onomatopoeia of Love
A gentle hum, \
As he sings the baby to sleep, \
The clanging of pans, \
As he cooks breakfast.  \
A gasp to hold back tears, \
On my darkest days,

A  hearty laugh,

When my jokes aren't funny. \
The symphony playing, \
From his compliments many. \
The sound of his voice, \
Greeting me after long days. \
All these wonderful sounds, \
Show that he loves me \
