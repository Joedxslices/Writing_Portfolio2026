**Prompt:** Fiction $\rightarrow$ nonfiction (or vice versa).

# The Parting
I yelled apparently. I knew my voice was a little raised, but I certainly wasn't yelling. Apparently, I scared people. It's never my intention to. Break ups are hard, especially when you have Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria. I suppose that comes with the ADHD. Lucky me, I got over it, and quickly. Well, sort of.

I went on a date the other week. It was kinda nice, I suppose. Bar trivia. A favorite, safe activity. Or so I figured.


[Yeah, it's just late, and I don't want to finish this. But it fits the prompt, so.....]
