**Prompt:** Something you learned by Accident \

There are a lot of things I learned without intending to. Most often it occurs while idly scrolling or watching a TV show. It's amazing the details that producers of TV shows and other media put in the background that sometimes get unnoticed. More often than not, I'll be watching something and a random fact will pop up and I'll remember it for ages. Or I'll unintentionally learn the definition of a word by reading a book. I understand that reading a book is considered more scholarly then watching TV, but information is transmitted through media. One of my favorite examples from TV is of course learning what an aglet is. Or listening to Weird Al and getting an impromptu lesson on types of hernias or of good practices in grammar. Media does have a good side and can be unintentionally educational if we take time to analyze it.
