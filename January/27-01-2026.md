# The Baritone
Elias Fogworthy was a well-known operatic baritone. Tonight was a benefit concert for charity. All proceeds would be donated to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Disease research. Other charities were considered, but this particular foundation meant a lot to Elias.

Elias arrived early to the venue for sound checks. His voice echoed nicely through the concert hall venue. The venue was small, fit for about 100 people. He wanted another run through of a particularly difficult passage before the rest of the crew did the rest of their checks. Unfortunately, he would not get another run through.

In a matter of moments, sirens echoed outside the concert venue. The venue was situated such that it shared an alley with a restaurant. In the alley was a dead body. Elias recognized the corpse immediately. Certainly his friend and fellow baritone could not be dead. Tears rolled down his face as the realization dawned on him. He couldn't go on with his show.

[A bit unfinished and could be expanded in places, but overall, I like the vibe of this.]
