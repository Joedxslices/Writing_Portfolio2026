**GIVEN FIRST LINE:** Everyone agreed this was a bad idea.

# The Set Up
Everyone agreed this was a bad idea. Something needed to be done about James though, and this was the best plan they could come up  with. It had its flaws, but everything else was equally or more horrible. James had been reclusive ever since the incident, which was mutually agreed upon not to be mentioned after. Reclusive wasn't exactly the correct term, but it was good enough in most everyone's eyes.

To say James was sad would suffice, though it was a deeper sadness. The kind of sadness that created a void, as all loss does. everyone in the group felt the loss, though it was much deeper with James. James would never say, not that he necessarily talked much, but even less so now.

James made ready to go out for the first time in what seemed like eons. He wore a nice suit, complete with bow-tie. He also insisted on wearing a cumberbund, though his reasoning would never see the light of day.

[Want to write more, but kind of late, and need to catch up on one more prompt tonight at least. another fairly okay write, but definitely need to elaborate on the plan, as that was the prompt. Free writes being what they are though...]
