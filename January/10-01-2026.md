# Charles Cornish
Charles Cornish was a professor who had recently achieved tenure as a professor. He kept his hair a short buzz cut, as disciplined as a soldier in the army. He would never go into the army if he could help it.  He wore his signature satchel over his left shoulder. The strap was just a little too long, so it swung and often hit just below his waist on his right leg. He would often find bruises on his leg after a day with lots of walking. Professors in his department would constantly encourage him to use a backpack instead, as they saw his chagrin at the satchel. Unbeknownst to those professors was the sentimental value of this satchel. It was a gift from Charles' father. Contained in the satchel was a puzzle box. This was Charles' only connection to his late father. So, yes he would wear it every day thank you very much. So long as the puzzle box and satchel were together, Charles felt an immense confidence that was unmeasurable.
