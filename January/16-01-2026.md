# The Proposal
An array of feelings flooded over Lauren. Each one she was unsure of how to deal with. One the one hand, she was surprised. This was not how she envisioned her day would end. On the other hand, she was angry that he hadn’t let her know beforehand that he was planning this. Her mind turned quickly to their first date. She had known that he was probably the one, even despite him throwing up on her favorite shoes. Despite all that, she had a wonderful time.

“I know, you wanted me to let you know in advance, but I couldn’t wait.” He had the goofy smile he always had. His eyes told the whole story, such a gentle and warm look. Jonathan had always cared for other people, but had a tendency to be a little impulsive. Was that a bad thing though? Spontaneity?

A thousand memories suddenly made their way back into Lauren’s memory, each one more splendid than the last. Late nights crying because of difficulties at work. Soup deliveries when she was sick. A romantic sunset as they sat on a bench at the park. This, she decided, was love.

“Yes, of course I’ll marry you.” She said enthusiastically. Jonathan smiled a wide grin, and rose to put the ring on Lauren’s finger. This decision was a good one, she could feel it.
