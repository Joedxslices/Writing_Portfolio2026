**Prompt:** A Small Ritual

# Nightly Routine
Often, I find that I can't fall asleep. So, when I stay up late doing whatever it is I am doing that day, usually  watching YouTube, I realize the time and go to brush my teeth. Every now and again, my mother is sleeping on the couch, as she finds it easier to fall asleep with background noise. So, as I pass by her going to or coming from the bathroom, I sign "I love you, Mom." It's just something small I do almost without thinking. She's not usually awake to see it, but it's something small that I do to show my appreciation of her.
