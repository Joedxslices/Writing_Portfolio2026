# A Familiar Place (without naming it)
The walls are adorned with chalkboards, a mathematician's favorite. Some slide to reveal whiteboards, which I suppose is customary some places. Tables fill most of the floor, with adequate walking room between the two rows. My favorite place though is the table situated next to the lectern. It feels like home in all the best ways. A nice hidey-hole to work. I'm not the only resident usually. There's hubbub of mathematics conversation, which also feels like home. It's near to some offices, which serve to facilitate office hours and students with homework question. It's a place I felt I belonged, at least until I left.
