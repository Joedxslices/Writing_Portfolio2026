# A Party Split
Prison. That's where she was now, or so Jenna supposed. Jenna couldn't exactly go back to Bludvar. She had also broken the law, but wasn't caught. This was a regret Jenna would take to her grave: leaving Alice in prison. Should she have got caught, so Alice wouldn't have to face the horrors of prison alone? Probably. But fear makes you do things you don't want to sometimes.

Alice didn't forget. She was one of the lucky ones though. Since there was no evidence of the crimes she had committed, aside from the words of the sheriff, whom the whole town knew was corrupt, after a few months, Alice was released. Alice  had not remained idle while she was in prison either.

Bludvar is well known for its despicable villagers. Chief among these was Bruse, who spent most of his time in the prison. He only acted like a saint in prison. People should have learned by now, but as is common in small towns, education is not a priority. Bruse took advantage of this fact. For he too, was left behind by someone he cared about.
