**Prompt:** \
Write a short letter to your January self. Offer permission. Set boundaries. Say what matters and what doesn't. \ \
Hey Joe,\
Looks like you completed your first month of writing prompts. Good on ya lad. Two months of prompts to go. I figure you'll miss a day here or there. That's alright. That just means you'll have two to do the next day. Don't feel like everything needs to be perfect. One of the good things about Git is that it's really good about version control stuff. You can write stuff now and change it later as you need. I understand you're a perfectionist, and that you want everything to be perfect the first time. Not really an option with ADHD. \
Life gets messy and that's okay. I hope you kept your promise to apply to more jobs. I know how ya feel about applying to things willy nilly, but ya just got to do it. Life won't always conform to your rules. And that's okay. You're strong, and ya got a good head on yer shoulders. Chin up. Tomorrow will be a better day. Use yer brain and do some good in this world. You're doin' alright. Remember to do things that make ya happy from time to time. Remember your future is so bright sometimes ya gotta wear shades. \
With regards,
Yer self
