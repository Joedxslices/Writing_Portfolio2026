**Prompt:** Write a poem that includes a question it never answers.

# What Does the Future Hold?
What does the Future hold, \
For the Hungry and cold? \
Shelter and Wealth? \
Goodness and Health? \
The chance to grow old?

What does the Future Hold, \
Concerning the meek and the bold? \
Greatness and success, \
A quiet recess, \
Or decay and mold?

What does the future hold, \
For both young and Old? \
A future we can't predict, \
Chance, like a coin you flicked. \
What will you decide?
