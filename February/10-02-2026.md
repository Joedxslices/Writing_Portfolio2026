**Prompt:** Something you avoid thinking about.

# The Future
I feel like the thing I'm most scared of are the things I can't see, which would be most things without my glasses. And only if it's relatively close. The future is very unseeable. I suppose you can see a little into the future, the close future, and that's alright. The far future though is what scares me.

I can't think of the future too much without wondering who I'll be. What will it be like? Who features prominently in it? How will I take care of myself? Will I even take care of myself? It's something I struggle with even living at home.

A normal job doesn't entirely interest me. My chosen career is unfortunately too niche, and because I refuse to do anything else, I feel stuck. I avoid applying to jobs, because I tend to get rejected, and that hurts more than applying for the job. I also don't believe much in applying to every job and hoping something will stick. I understand that to be the preferred method for many people, but I want to be happy in a job (which I also understand is unlikely, but I can't shake myself of this delusion.)
