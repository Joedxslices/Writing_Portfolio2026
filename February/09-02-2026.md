**Genre Prompt:** A love story without romance.

# Arranged
No stress. Everything was planned to perfection. My favorite flowers adorned the small chapel. The pews were filled with family, those I chose, and those I hadn't. A string quartet played Mendelssohn. Everything was how I imagined it. Everything, that is, except the groom.

I was known as the town ugly. Before you make any assumptions, I am beautiful, but when everyone in your town is beautiful, it's hard to get noticed. I had what people called quiet beauty, which was undesirable. Quiet beauty didn't make the most beautiful babies, so they often grew up to become single cat ladies.

Father looked me in the eye one last time before he let me go. "I know Gary will give you a happy life. I trust him to take care of you." his voice cracked as he wiped a tear from his eye. Marriage was the key to success these days, and Father always wanted success for his children.

...

"Kathy, we need to go, now." His voice woke me. I hadn't even remembered falling asleep. He shook me again and I sat up still groggy. "Kathy, now. The shelter."
