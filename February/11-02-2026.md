# Ode to Courage
Remember the white knight. \
Valiant and bold, \
Never turning back, \
Neither should you. 

Remember the white knight, \
A courageous piece, \
Jumping into the fray, \
To protect its home.

Remember the white knight, \
Sparkling in valor, \
Bruised, but not broken, \
Continuing when tired.

Remember the white knight \
When the battle is over, \
A life given, a life saved, \
Worth it in the end.

Remember the white knight. \
Valiant and bold, \
Never turning back, \
Neither should you.
