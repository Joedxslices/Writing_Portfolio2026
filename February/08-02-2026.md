**GIVEN FIRST LINE:** “I mistook familiarity for safety.”

# The Reunion
I mistook familiarity for safety. I had walked these halls many times when I went to high school, and they gave me a sense of comfort that I could never explain. I walked past my old French classroom and smiled as I passed by. Lessons with Madame were the best. We were instructed to only call her Madame, though technically her name was Madame Taylor. Hard to believe she still taught here after so many years.

I know, it's a reunion, and I was supposed to reminisce with old friends, not hang around the actual school. It felt nice to be alone and just remember the good times, what few of those there were. None of my actual friends were here anyways. They all moved on with their lives, and didn't have time for a silly high school reunion. I would have moved on, if I didn't have a secret of my own to keep.

[This is alright. Could be a nice cheesy cozy, hallmarky mystery book.]
