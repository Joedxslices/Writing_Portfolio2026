# The Crime Scene
Crime was on an upswing after a fatal accident. A memorial was held for a downed officer. No one was charged in the crime. This, it is supposed, is what gave most people the thought that they could get away with murder and other crimes. They were wrong.

One particular gloomy day is where our story begins. A simple crime. Domestic, or so the neighbors assumed. A crime of passion, that much was evident. A lovers spat. The mess left by the fight that occurred before the death rivaled the catastrophe of a tornado gone wrong. Shards of fine china spread like the shrapnel of a grenade. Broken appliances, showing their wounds through frayed wires. Red stains on the rug from the spillage of a nice wine. Yes, the crime seemed simple. It was anything but.

One simple piece of evidence seemed damning: a knife in the back. This would condemn the murderer, quickly, easily. Fingerprints and DNA could be obtained. Though, this knife in and of itself was a mystery. It did not match those in the knife block in the kitchen. The wife, bruised and scarred was adamant that she did not stab her husband, but had simply found him, lying in a pool of his blood.
