## Introduction
Learning too late in college what I wanted to do in my life, and not having much success finding work afterwards (though, if we're honest, I didn't really try...), I decided I needed to start honing some skills. I want to work in editing, despite my degree in mathematics. I found so much joy helping a professor refine a textbook for a class, I decided that was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. As a first step, after a gap year and not finding work, this portfolio of writing will take place over the first 3 months of 2026, and longer, should I see fit.

## Writing Prompts and AI Usage
I'm sure there are many ways that I could have gotten daily prompts for this portfolio. I opted to have ChatGPT generate them for me. This was the most convenient way I could find, and would be, for the most part, what I used generative AI for. It is my intent that I will use Youtube to help me set this the rest of the way up in GitHub, and I will link the videos I used below in some form or fashion. I will also link the conversation I had with ChatGPT to show how much it was used during this project. If I have to re-share the conversation, I will re-link as often as I need to.
